<h2>NRG Game's Privacy policy</h2>
<br>
The game itself doesn't access the Internet at all. No data on the user is gathered, other than what Android itself collects for every app installed (like crash reports).
<br><br>
The game never attempts to track any of your doings outside of it. The game does track your performance in playing it, but it never sends the data anywhere, it is, however, available for backup, should your device be configured to perform it. 
<br><br>
Enjoy the finest privacy as you play.
